## Project developed as part of Alura’s #7DaysOfCode challenge. The goal was to create a website for the fictional company OptimusTech in 7 days, following a layout provided in Figma.

## How did this challenge work?
### Over the course of one week, I received a daily challenge to build one section of the OptimusTech website at a time (header, jobs section, footer, etc.), with the main objective of delivering a website focused on attracting new talent to the company.

### This project was developed using the following web technologies:
